title: "7: Putting it All Together"
layout: module
nav_order: 7
summary: >
    In this module, we'll combine everything we've looked at in previous modules to build a real-time notification system that uses HTTP, gRPC, message queues and SignalR notifications.
---

In the final part of the workshop, we're going to combine all the patterns and protocols we've seen so far to create a distributed application that will notify users when a new car is advertised for sale.

1. A new vehicle is added to the platform via the REST API
2. The web app publishes a notification using pub/sub and EasyNetQ
3. A subscriber receives that notification, uses the gRPC service to calculate a price, and then publishes a NewVehiclePriceMessage
4. Another subscriber receives that message, translates it into a SignalR notification, and pushes it to the SignalR hub running in our web application.

Our completed application will look like this:

**High quality version: [autobarn-architecture-diagram.pdf](assets/autobarn-architecture-diagram.pdf)**

To implement this system, we're going to modify components we've created over the course of the workshop.

### Autobarn.Messages

We need to add a new class to our shared `Autobarn.Messages` assembly, so we can publish notifications about a vehicle price calculation. This class will inherit from our existing `NewVehicleMessage` class, and add new fields for the vehicle price and currency.

Add a new class `NewVehiclePriceMessage` to the `Autobarn.Messages` project, with the following code:

```csharp
namespace Autobarn.Messages {
	public class NewVehiclePriceMessage : NewVehicleMessage {
		public int Price { get; set; }
		public string CurrencyCode { get; set; }
	}
}
```

We'll also add an extension helper method to make it easier to translate `NewVehicleMessage` objects into `NewVehiclePriceMessage` objects:

```csharp
public static class MessageExtensions {
	public static NewVehiclePriceMessage ToNewVehiclePriceMessage(this NewVehicleMessage incomingMessage, int price,
		string currencyCode) {
		return new NewVehiclePriceMessage {
			Manufacturer = incomingMessage.Manufacturer,
			ModelCode = incomingMessage.ModelCode,
			Color = incomingMessage.Color,
			ModelName = incomingMessage.ModelName,
			Registration = incomingMessage.Registration,
			Year = incomingMessage.Year,
			CurrencyCode = currencyCode,
			Price = price
		};
	}
}
```

> â„¹ If you find yourself doing this a lot in your applications, check out [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/), which makes it really easy to map data between objects with similar structures and fields.

### Autobarn.PricingClient

We need to modify the `PricingClient` so that it will subscribe to messages published from our web app. 

First, you'll need to add the `EasyNetQ` NuGet package:

```
dotnet add package EasyNetQ
```

Now, we need to modify `Program.cs` so that it will:

1. Subscribe to `NewVehicleMessage` messages 
2. When a `NewVehicleMessage` arrives, it will create a new `PriceRequest` and send this to the `PricingServer` gRPC endpoint
3. When the `PriceReply` comes back, create a new `NewVehiclePriceMessage` including the pricing information, and publish it to the message bus.

Here's the complete code. (Note that we've also added some code for reading our configuration from the `appsettings.json` file; you'll need to add this to your project and set "Copy to Output Directory" to "**Copy if newer**" )

```csharp
using Autobarn.PricingServer;
using Grpc.Net.Client;
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Autobarn.Messages;
using EasyNetQ;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;

namespace Autobarn.PricingClient {
	class Program {
		private static readonly IConfigurationRoot config = ReadConfiguration();
		private const string SUBSCRIBER_ID = "Autobarn.PricingClient";
		private static Pricer.PricerClient grpcClient;
		private static IBus bus;

		static async Task Main(string[] args) {
			var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress(config["AutobarnPricingServerUrl"]);
			grpcClient = new Pricer.PricerClient(channel);

			bus = RabbitHutch.CreateBus(config.GetConnectionString("AutobarnRabbitMQ"));
			await bus.PubSub.SubscribeAsync<NewVehicleMessage>(SUBSCRIBER_ID, HandleNewVehicleMessage);
			Console.WriteLine("Connected! Listening for NewVehicleMessage messages.");
			Console.ReadKey(true);
		}

		private static async Task HandleNewVehicleMessage(NewVehicleMessage incomingMessage) {
			var request = new PriceRequest {
				ModelCode = incomingMessage.ModelCode,
				Color = incomingMessage.Color,
				Year = incomingMessage.Year
			};
			var reply = await grpcClient.GetPriceAsync(request);
			var outgoingMessage = incomingMessage.ToNewVehiclePriceMessage(reply.Price, reply.CurrencyCode);
			await bus.PubSub.PublishAsync(outgoingMessage);
		}

		private static IConfigurationRoot ReadConfiguration() {
			var basePath = Directory.GetParent(AppContext.BaseDirectory).FullName;
			return new ConfigurationBuilder()
				.SetBasePath(basePath)
				.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
				.AddEnvironmentVariables()
				.Build();
		}
	}
}
```

Here's the contents of `appsettings.json`:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AutobarnRabbitMQ": "amqp://user:pass@localhost:5672"
  },
  "AutobarnPricingServerUrl" :  "https://localhost:5003" 
}
```

### Autobarn.Notifier

Next, we're going to modify the `Autobarn.Notifier` service so that it subscribes to the message queue and listens for `NewVehiclePriceMessage` messages. When a `NewVehiclePriceMessage` arrives, the notifier will translate this into a SignalR notification and push it to the SignalR hub.

We'll need to install the `EasyNetQ` NuGet package, the packages we need to use `appsettings.json` for our configuration, and the `Newtonsoft.Json` serializer. From the `Autobarn.Notifier` folder, run:

```
dotnet add package EasyNetQ
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileExtensions
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

Now we need to modify our `Program.cs` to subscribe to messages, translate those message into SignalR notifications, and push them to our SignalR hub. Rather than mapping them into a different message type, we'll just JSON-encode the `NewVehiclePriceMessage` and push the JSON document to the SignalR hub, where we can broadcast it to all connected web browsers and then rely on our client-side JavaScript code to deserialize and format it.

Here's the code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client;
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Autobarn.Messages;
using EasyNetQ;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization;

namespace Autobarn.Notifier {
	class Program {
		private static readonly IConfigurationRoot config = ReadConfiguration();
		private static HubConnection hub;
		private static IBus bus;
		private const string SUBSCRIBER = "Autobarn.Notifier";

		static async Task Main(string[] args) {
			JsonConvert.DefaultSettings = JsonSettings;

			hub = new HubConnectionBuilder().WithUrl(config["AutobarnSignalRHubUrl"]).Build();
			await hub.StartAsync();
			Console.WriteLine("Connected to SignalR Hub.");
			bus = RabbitHutch.CreateBus(config.GetConnectionString("AutobarnRabbitMQ"));
			await bus.PubSub.SubscribeAsync<NewVehiclePriceMessage>(SUBSCRIBER, HandleNewVehiclePriceMessage);
			Console.WriteLine("Connected to message bus. Listening for NewVehiclePriceMessages.");
			Console.ReadKey(false);
		}

		private static async Task HandleNewVehiclePriceMessage(NewVehiclePriceMessage message) {
			var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(message);
			Console.WriteLine($"Sending JSON to hub: {json}");
			await hub.SendAsync("NotifyWebUsers", "Autobarn.Notifier", json);
			Console.WriteLine("Sent!");
		}

		private static JsonSerializerSettings JsonSettings() =>
			new JsonSerializerSettings {
				ContractResolver = new DefaultContractResolver {
					NamingStrategy = new CamelCaseNamingStrategy()
				}
			};

		private static IConfigurationRoot ReadConfiguration() {
			var basePath = Directory.GetParent(AppContext.BaseDirectory).FullName;
			return new ConfigurationBuilder().SetBasePath(basePath)
				.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json").AddEnvironmentVariables().Build();
		}
	}
}
```

You'll also need to add an `appsettings.json` file to the `Autobarn.Notifier` project:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "AutobarnRabbitMQ": "amqs://user:pass@localhost:5672"
  },
  "AutobarnPricingServerUrl": "https://localhost:5003",
  "AutobarnSignalRHubUrl": "https://localhost:5001/hub"
}
```

That's it.

To see our whole system in action, we'll need to start all the following services:

1. Autobarn.Website
2. Autobarn.PricingServer
3. Autobarn.Notifier
4. Autobarn.PricingClient
5. Autobarn.AuditLog

Once all your services are running, add a new vehicle to the system by making an HTTP `POST` request to the Autobarn.Website's `/api/vehicles/` endpoint, and you should see each component in turn pick up the appropriate message, relay it to another service, and eventually display a notification popup in your web browser.
